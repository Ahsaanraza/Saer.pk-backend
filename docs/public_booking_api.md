# Public Booking Status API

This document describes the public booking status API which allows customers to view booking details using a booking number or a secure public reference (used in QR links).

## Purpose
Allow end-users (customers) to check their booking status and public-facing details without authentication. Only non-sensitive data is exposed.

## Endpoints
- GET /api/public/booking-status/<booking_no>/
  - Lookup by booking number (public read-only)
  - Example: GET /api/public/booking-status/BK-20251031-ABC123/

- GET /api/public/booking-status/?ref=PUBLIC_REF
  - Lookup by secure public reference token (recommended for QR links)
  - Example: GET /api/public/booking-status/?ref=INV-BK-20251031-ABCDEF123456

Both endpoints return the same payload structure.

  üîí Data Privacy Notes

  Internal IDs, organizations, agents, commissions, and financial ledgers are never exposed.

  Document URLs are public-safe or signed (no raw file paths).

  Security & Rate Limiting

  Aspect	Description
  Token Generation	public_ref generated with HMAC-SHA256 using Django SECRET_KEY + booking data.
  Rate Limit	10 requests/min per IP (configurable in DRF settings).
  Abuse Prevention	Returns 404 for invalid or expired references. Consider CAPTCHA or temporary blocking for heavy access.

  QR Integration

  Each booking has a public_ref stored in the Booking.public_ref field.

  Suggested QR link format for client emails or invoices:

  https://saer.pk/order-status/?ref={public_ref}

  üß∞ Management Command

  To generate or regenerate secure public references:

  python manage.py generate_public_refs --print-qr
  # To regenerate all references (use with caution)
  python manage.py generate_public_refs --regenerate

  Admin & Operational Notes

  Migration file: booking/migrations/0069_add_public_ref.py

  Run migrations after pull:

  python manage.py migrate


  Add public_ref to Django Admin display/search for easy lookup.

  For secure media access, use short-lived signed URLs for any uploaded files.

  Troubleshooting

  Issue	Resolution
  public_ref missing for old bookings	Run python manage.py generate_public_refs
  Throttle limit reached (HTTP 429)	Increase rate limit in settings.py under REST_FRAMEWORK['DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES']
  Incorrect data fields returned	Check PublicBookingSerializer for field whitelisting

  Future Enhancements
