# Changes Summary â€” 2025-10-27

This document lists the code changes made in the repository during the recent session, and identifies the exact files and folders changed so you can review, test, or revert them.

## High-level summary
- Added `excluded_tickets` to the `UmrahPackage` API response (full Ticket objects for sentinel-excluded tickets).
- Added computed price fields to the `UmrahPackage` serializer: `adult_price`, `infant_price`, `child_discount`, and room price fields.
- Implemented allowed-reseller-aware filtering for `UmrahPackage` querysets in the packages viewset.
- Added reselling & commission fields to `UmrahPackage` model and created a migration file.
- Fixed import/lint issues and verified serializer import via a quick Django import check.

## Files changed (location -> purpose)

- packages/serializers.py
  - Path: `packages/serializers.py`
  - Purpose: Main changes for Umrah package API representation.
    - Added SerializerMethodField `excluded_tickets` that returns full Ticket objects where any of the seat-related fields equals `2147483647` and that are not included in the package's `ticket_details`.
    - Added computed fields: `adult_price`, `infant_price`, `child_discount`, `quint_room_price`, `quad_room_price`, `triple_room_price`, `double_room_price`, `sharing_bed_price`.
    - Imported `django.db.models` for building Q filters.

- packages/views.py
  - Path: `packages/views.py`
  - Purpose: `UmrahPackageViewSet.get_queryset` updated to:
    - Require `organization` query param.
    - Resolve allowed owner organization ids for the requesting reseller (via `AllowedReseller`) and include owner packages + inventory_owner packages.
    - Filter `is_active` when requested.
    - Exclude packages whose included tickets have departure datetimes < now (applies to packages with tickets).
    - Enforce `reselling_allowed=True` for reseller callers where appropriate.
    - Note: added `from booking.models import AllowedReseller` and `from django.utils import timezone`.

- packages/models.py
  - Path: `packages/models.py`
  - Purpose: Model fields added earlier in the session for `UmrahPackage`:
    - `reselling_allowed` (Boolean)
    - Commission fields per pax: `area_agent_commission_adult/child/infant`, `branch_commission_adult/child/infant` (FloatField)
    - BigInteger seat counters: `total_seats`, `left_seats`, `booked_seats`, `confirmed_seats` (already present or updated).

- packages/migrations/0030_umrahpackage_resell_commission.py
  - Path: `packages/migrations/0030_umrahpackage_resell_commission.py`
  - Purpose: Adds `reselling_allowed` and the commission FloatFields to `UmrahPackage` (migration file created; apply it via `python manage.py migrate`).

- booking/* and tickets/* (summary of earlier session work)
  - Files touched across the session (not all are changed in the last commit but included for context):
    - `booking/models.py`, `booking/serializers.py`, `booking/signals.py`, `booking/migrations/*`
    - `tickets/models.py`, `tickets/views.py`
  - Purpose (context): implemented seat accounting signal handlers, payment fields, allowed-reseller schema changes, and ticket/hotel reselling/owner fields.

- docs/
  - New file: `docs/changes_summary_2025-10-27.md` (this document)

## How `excluded_tickets` works
- The serializer finds Ticket records where any of the fields `total_seats`, `left_seats`, `booked_tickets`, or `confirmed_tickets` equals the sentinel `2147483647`.
- Tickets that are already part of the package's `ticket_details` are excluded from the `excluded_tickets` list.
- The serializer uses the existing `TicketSerializer` to return the full Ticket JSON object(s).

## Computed price fields
- `adult_price` => `adault_visa_price` (keeps the original field name from the model).
- `infant_price` => `infant_visa_price + ticket_price` (uses the first included ticket's `adult_price` as `ticket_price` fallback; if no ticket present, `ticket_price` treated as 0).
- `child_discount` => uses `child_visa_price` as a flat child value.
- Room prices (`quint_room_price`, `quad_room_price`, `triple_room_price`, `double_room_price`, `sharing_bed_price`) => taken from the first `hotel_details` entry on the package (fields on `UmrahPackageHotelDetails`), or `null` if the package has no hotel details.

## Quick verification steps (PowerShell)
1. Run migrations (if not yet applied):

```powershell
$env:DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = "configuration.settings_local"
python manage.py migrate packages
```

2. Quick import check (what was run in session):

```powershell
$env:DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = "configuration.settings_local"
python -c "import os, django; os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE','configuration.settings_local'); django.setup(); from packages.serializers import UmrahPackageSerializer; print('IMPORT_OK')"
```

3. Serialize a package from shell to inspect output (replace <id> with a real package id):

```powershell
$env:DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = "configuration.settings_local"
python - <<'PY'
import os, django
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE','configuration.settings_local')
django.setup()
from packages.models import UmrahPackage
from packages.serializers import UmrahPackageSerializer
pkg = UmrahPackage.objects.first()  # or .get(id=<id>)
print(UmrahPackageSerializer(pkg).data)
PY
```

## Notes & next steps
- Tests: I recommend adding unit tests for the serializer behavior (excluded tickets selection and price computations) and for `UmrahPackageViewSet` filtering (owner vs allowed-reseller logic and reselling flag enforcement).
- Data migration: if you have production data where `2147483647` is used as the sentinel for unlimited/placeholder seats, this code will include those tickets in `excluded_tickets`. If you use a different sentinel, update the value in `packages/serializers.py`.
- Edge cases:
  - Infant price uses the first included ticket's `adult_price`; if a package includes multiple tickets with different prices you may prefer a different rule (e.g., sum or min/max).
  - Room prices are taken from the first hotel details. If packages include multiple hotels with different room pricing, consider returning an array per hotel instead.

If you want, I can also:
- Add unit tests under `packages/tests.py` for the new serializer fields and queryset behavior.
- Add OpenAPI / API docs updates reflecting the new fields.
- Produce a short PR summary ready to paste into your PR description.

If you'd like any of these, tell me which and I'll proceed.
