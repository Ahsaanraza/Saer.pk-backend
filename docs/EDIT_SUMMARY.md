# Edit Summary — Where and Why

This document lists the files we edited during the recent session, what we changed in each file, and why. Use this as a quick map when reviewing or deploying the edits. All paths are relative to the repository root.

## 1. booking/tests.py
- Path: `booking/tests.py`
- What changed:
  - Fixed test fixtures to create valid related objects required by models:
    - Created `City` with `organization` and `code` fields.
    - Created an `Airlines` instance and used it to create a `Ticket` (satisfies FK constraint).
- Why:
  - Tests were failing during test DB setup because `packages.City` requires non-null `organization` and `code`, and `tickets.Ticket` requires a valid `Airlines` FK. Updating fixtures ensures tests can run in an isolated test DB.

## 2. booking/migrations/0060_add_ticket_included.py
- Path: `booking/migrations/0060_add_ticket_included.py`
- What changed:
  - Added a new migration that adds the `ticket_included` BooleanField to `BookingPersonDetail` model.
- Why:
  - The models reference `ticket_included` but the test database schema did not include that column. Adding a migration makes test and runtime schemas consistent and prevents "no column" errors during tests.

## 3. booking/signals.py
- Path: `booking/signals.py`
- What changed:
  - Added a `post_delete` signal handler for `BookingTicketDetails` to restore ticket counters when a booking's ticket details are deleted (including cascade deletes).
  - Removed ticket counter handling from `booking_post_delete` to prevent duplicate restores; `booking_post_delete` now handles Umrah package counters only.
  - Adjusted the `post_delete` handler to inspect the parent booking's status (if available) to decide whether to decrement `booked_tickets` or `confirmed_tickets`. Falls back to decrementing `booked_tickets` if booking status isn't available.
- Why:
  - Cascade deletes can remove `BookingTicketDetails` without calling their `delete()` method; a `post_delete` signal ensures counters are always corrected.
  - Avoids double-adjustment when both booking-level and ticket-detail-level handlers try to fix seats.
  - Using the parent booking's status improves correctness (decrement confirmed vs booked counters appropriately).

## 4. docs/EDIT_SUMMARY.md
- Path: `docs/EDIT_SUMMARY.md` (this file)
- What changed:
  - New documentation file summarizing edits and reasons.
- Why:
  - Provides a concise change log and guidance for reviewers and deployers.

## How I validated the changes
- Ran Django test runner for the booking app under local settings (`configuration.settings_local`):

```powershell
$env:DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="configuration.settings_local"; python manage.py test booking -v 2
```

- Outcome: All added booking unit tests passed locally (5 tests).

## Next recommended steps
- Commit and push the migration (`booking/migrations/0060_add_ticket_included.py`) to the repository so CI/staging apply it.
- Review pax-to-ticket allocation logic in `booking/signals.py` if you want a more sophisticated distribution across multiple `BookingTicketDetails`.
- Run full test suite and static analysis in CI.

If you want, I can now open a PR with these edits and run a quick CI checklist (lint/tests) or expand this doc to include exact patch diffs.

## AllowedReseller / Discount groups — where to edit and how it works

Files touched / where to look:

- `booking/models.py`
  - Class: `AllowedReseller`
  - What you'll find: fields `inventory_owner_company` (FK to OrganizationLink), `reseller_company` (FK to `Organization` — single reseller id), `allowed_types` (JSONField list), `discount_group` (FK to `DiscountGroup`), and `requested_status_by_reseller` (status).
  - Why edit here: this is the canonical model for which resellers are allowed to sell which inventory. Change model fields here if you need different names, behaviors or DB constraints.

- `booking/migrations/0052_allowedreseller.py` and `booking/migrations/0059_update_allowedreseller.py`
  - What you'll find: original M2M definition (0052) and the data-preserving migration (0059) which converts the old `reseller_companies` M2M into individual rows with a single `reseller_company` FK, adds `discount_group`, and renames `allowed` -> `allowed_types`.
  - Why edit here: migrations reflect historical schema changes — only edit with care. If you need to change how historical data is migrated, edit `0059_update_allowedreseller.py` and re-run migration in a safe environment.

- `booking/serializers.py`
  - Class: `AllowedResellerSerializer`
  - What you'll find: `reseller_company` and `discount_group` exposed as `PrimaryKeyRelatedField` (single IDs), `allowed_types` included in the serializer (JSON list). The serializer's `create` / `update` methods persist the model fields.
  - Why edit here: change field exposure, validation, or representation (e.g., to return nested org objects instead of IDs).

- `booking/views.py`
  - Class: `AllowedResellerViewSet`
  - What you'll find: a standard DRF `ModelViewSet` exposing CRUD endpoints at `/api/allowed-resellers/`.
  - Why edit here: add permissions, custom filtering (for org-level visibility), or custom create/update logic (for example to enforce that only SuperAdmins may create links).

- `booking/urls.py`
  - Registers the route `allowed-resellers` for the viewset.

How the fields map to your requested API shape

- Old shape (existing in older migrations / payloads):
  - `reseller_companies`: array of organization IDs (M2M)
  - `commission_group_id`: integer field

- New/current shape (what the codebase implements):
  - `reseller_company`: single integer id (FK to `Organization`) — see `booking.models.AllowedReseller.reseller_company`
  - `discount_group` (or `discount_group_id`): FK to `DiscountGroup` (id available in serializer) — use `discount_group` in JSON payloads
  - `allowed_types`: JSON array with any of these string values: `"GROUP_TICKETS"`, `"UMRAH_PACKAGES"`, `"HOTELS"` (multiple values allowed)

Example JSON payload to create an AllowedReseller via the API:

{
  "inventory_owner_company": 12,
  "reseller_company": 5,
  "discount_group": 3,
  "allowed_types": ["GROUP_TICKETS", "HOTELS"]
}

Notes about the 403 "Missing 'organization' query parameter." error

- Where it comes from: The `tickets` endpoints (and some other list endpoints) currently require a query parameter `organization` to load results for a specific organization. See `tickets/views.py` — the view raises PermissionDenied if `organization` is missing.
- How to avoid it (example):

```powershell
$env:DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="configuration.settings_local"; python manage.py runserver
# then call the tickets list with an organization id
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/tickets/?organization=1"
```

- If you prefer the endpoint to be usable without `?organization`, I can change `TicketViewSet.get_queryset` to fall back to the authenticated user's organization (or to return a global tenant-safe set). Tell me the desired behavior and I'll implement it.

If you'd like, I can now:
- (A) Add API docs examples to the OpenAPI/YAML file showing the `AllowedReseller` create payload.
- (B) Make `?organization` optional on `tickets` endpoints and use a sensible default (authenticated user's org, or `organization` header). Note: changing this affects security/visibility rules.
- (C) Open a PR with the updated docs and small tests that show POST/GET for `AllowedReseller` using the new single `reseller_company` field.

Tell me which of (A)-(C) you'd like next, or I can implement all three.
