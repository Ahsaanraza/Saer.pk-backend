# Rules Management API — Work Summary (2025-10-29)

This document summarizes the work completed to implement the Rules Management API, the files changed, migrations applied, tests run, and recommended next steps.

## Purpose
Provide a clear API to manage dynamic, multilingual, versioned "rules" shown across product pages. Requirements implemented:
- Create, update (upsert), list, and soft-delete rules
- Filters: type, page, language
- Version incrementing on updates
- Admin-only write access (create/update/delete)
- JSONField for pages_to_display with compatibility fallback for DBs lacking JSON lookup support

## What I implemented
1. Data model
   - `Rule` model added to `organization/models.py` with fields:
     - `title` (string)
     - `description` (text)
     - `rule_type` (string / choice)
     - `pages_to_display` (JSONField)
     - `is_active` (boolean)
     - `language` (string)
     - `version` (integer)
     - `created_by` / `updated_by` (integers for audit)
     - `created_at` / `updated_at` (timestamps)

2. Serializer
   - `RuleSerializer` added to `organization/serializers.py` with validation:
     - `title` required
     - `description` min length (10 chars)
     - `rule_type` restricted to allowed values
     - `pages_to_display` must be a list/array of page identifiers
     - `language` validated
   - `update()` increments `version` automatically on updates.

3. Views / Endpoints
   - `RuleCreateView` — POST `/api/rules/create` (upsert if `id` provided). Admin-only.
   - `RuleListView` — GET `/api/rules/list` (filters: `type`, `page`, `language`). Public read.
     - Uses `pages_to_display__contains=[page]` for JSON lookup and forces a minimal evaluation to catch DB backends that raise `NotSupportedError` during SQL compilation; falls back to `pages_to_display__icontains=page` when necessary.
   - `RuleUpdateView` — PUT `/api/rules/update/<id>`: Admin-only update; increments version and sets `updated_by`.
   - `RuleDeleteView` — DELETE `/api/rules/delete/<id>`: Admin-only soft delete (sets `is_active=False`).

4. Routes
   - Registered in `organization/urls.py`:
     - `/api/rules/create`
     - `/api/rules/list`
     - `/api/rules/update/<id>`
     - `/api/rules/delete/<id>`

5. Migrations
   - `organization/migrations/0010_rule.py` created and adjusted to use integer audit fields for `created_by` and `updated_by` to avoid FK dependency on `auth_user` during test DB migrations.
   - In local/test runs, some migrations were faked where tables already existed to align migration state with the DB.

6. Tests
   - Tests added to `organization/tests.py` covering:
     - Create success and validation error
     - List filtering (including page filtering and JSON contains fallback)
     - Update increments version
     - Delete soft-deactivates
     - Permission checks (non-admin cannot create/update/delete)
   - Local test run (organization app): `python manage.py test organization.tests -v 2` — all organization tests pass (9 tests).

## Files changed / added (high level)
- Modified:
  - `organization/models.py` — added `Rule` model
  - `organization/serializers.py` — added `RuleSerializer`
  - `organization/views.py` — added Rule views and JSON lookup fallback (forced evaluation)
  - `organization/urls.py` — registered rule routes
  - `organization/migrations/0010_rule.py` — migration created/edited
  - `organization/tests.py` — tests for Rules API
- Added docs:
  - `docs/rules_management_brief.md` (developer brief)
  - `docs/rules_work_summary_2025-10-29.md` (this file)

## How I verified
- Ran the `organization` app tests locally and confirmed all tests passed:

  python manage.py test organization.tests -v 2

  Output: 9 tests ran, OK (see test logs). Test DB uses an in-memory sqlite backend; the JSON contains fallback was added specifically to handle NotSupportedError raised by sqlite for JSON contains lookups.

## Edge cases & decisions
- Audit columns: `created_by` and `updated_by` are stored as integer IDs instead of `ForeignKey(User)` to avoid migration FK errors in environments where `auth_user` may not be available at migration time. This is a deliberate trade-off to reduce migration complexity; converting to FKs is optional and listed below.
- JSON contains lookup: Some DBs do not support `JSONField` contains lookup. Implemented a defensive fallback to use `icontains` on the JSON text when necessary. This is less precise but ensures compatibility for read filtering in tests and non-MySQL environments.

## Next / recommended steps (prioritized)
1. Seed fixture or management command for sample rules (dev/UI testing) — low effort, high value.
2. Add a unit test specifically targeting the JSON contains fallback path to prevent regressions — quick and low-risk.
3. Decide on audit FK migration: convert `created_by`/`updated_by` integer fields back to `ForeignKey(User)` with a safe migration plan across environments — medium risk.
4. Implement a revision/history table or connect to existing audit logging to store full rule history and enable rollbacks — medium effort.
5. Run the full project test suite (all apps) and CI pipeline, and fix any cross-app regressions.

## Quick commands
- Run organization tests only (verified):

```powershell
python manage.py test organization.tests -v 2
```

- Run all tests (may take longer):

```powershell
python manage.py test
```

## Completion status
The Rules Management API is implemented and unit-tested for the organization app. The feature is developer-ready. Remaining tasks are optional improvements and developer convenience items (fixtures, stricter FK audits, additional tests).

---
If you'd like, I can now:
- Add a `fixtures/rules_sample.json` fixture and a short `README.md` on how to load it, or
- Implement the dedicated unit test for the JSON contains fallback, or
- Draft a safe migration plan to convert audit ints to `ForeignKey(User)`.

Which would you like next?
