# Receive Payment → Ledger: Implementation Summary

Date: 2025-10-31

This document summarizes what we implemented for the "Receive Payment" / payment → ledger integration, why the changes were made, and how to verify or operate the new pieces. It maps the client's requested behavior to the actual code changes made in the repository.

## Client request (as recorded)
- Add transaction_type to `Payment` to describe sender → receiver flows (agent→branch, area_agent→org, branch→org, org→org).
- Add approve/reject endpoints for payments. Approve should post ledger entries (debit/credit). Reject should create an action log and not post the ledger.
- Auto-generate `transaction_number` on new Payments when missing.
- Keep an audit trail: an action log for payment actions (approved, rejected, ledger created, posting failure).
- Ensure ledger posting is atomic, idempotent, and uses conversion for SAR→PKR where needed.
- Provide a reconciliation path to post ledger entries for payments created via bulk operations (e.g., `bulk_create` bypassing signals).

## High-level changes implemented

- Booking / Payments
  - `booking.models.Payment`:
    - Added `transaction_type` field (choices include `agent_to_branch`, `area_agent_to_org`, `branch_to_org`, `org_to_org`).
    - Implemented `save()` override to auto-generate a `transaction_number` when missing (format: `PAY-<ORGID>-YYYYMMDD-<seq4>`).
  - `booking.models.PaymentActionLog`:
    - New model to capture actions on payments (created, approved, rejected, ledger_entry_created, payment_post_failed).

- Ledger posting logic
  - `ledger.signals.auto_post_payment` (post_save receiver for `Payment`):
    - Triggers posting when Payment.status is `Completed` or `approved`.
    - Idempotent: searches `LedgerEntry.metadata` for `payment_id` and skips duplicates.
    - Routes payer account selection based on `transaction_type`; creates accounts where necessary.
    - Groups booking items by `inventory_owner_organization` and posts a LedgerEntry per owner organization.
    - Uses `convert_sar_to_pkr` (Decimal-based) when item prices are in SAR.
    - Uses `transaction.atomic()` and `select_for_update()` on involved accounts to ensure atomic balance updates.
    - Creates `LedgerLine` rows (debit for payer, credit for owner organization), updates Account balances, and records `LedgerEntry.metadata` including `payment_id` and `transaction_type`.
    - Attempts to create a `PaymentActionLog` record with `action='ledger_entry_created'`. On failure to create the log it appends a short trace to `payment.remarks` as a persistent fallback.

- Reconciliation
  - `booking/management/commands/reconcile_payments.py` (new):
    - Scans for Payments in completed state without a corresponding `LedgerEntry` (by `metadata.payment_id`).
    - Dry-run mode by default (lists payments). Use `--apply` to invoke the same posting handler used by signals to create missing ledger entries.
    - `--limit` to bound the number of payments processed in one run.

- Tests
  - `booking/tests/test_payments.py` (new):
    - `test_approve_creates_ledger_and_action_log`: approves a payment (status → Completed) and asserts a `LedgerEntry` with `metadata.payment_id`, two `LedgerLine`s, and a `PaymentActionLog` with `action='ledger_entry_created'` exist.
    - `test_posting_failure_creates_payment_post_failed_log`: simulates ledger posting failure and asserts `PaymentActionLog` with `action='payment_post_failed'` is created.
    - `test_reconcile_command_posts_missing_ledgers`: simulates a `bulk_create` payment (which would not trigger signals) and asserts the `reconcile_payments` management command posts a ledger entry when run with `--apply`.

## Files added / edited (one-line purpose)
- booking/models.py: added `transaction_type`, `transaction_number` auto-generation, and `PaymentActionLog` model.
- booking/views.py: approve/reject actions — approve enforces permission, sets status to Completed, and logs action; reject logs rejection and does not post ledger.
- booking/management/commands/reconcile_payments.py: new reconciliation command (dry-run / apply).
- booking/tests/test_payments.py: unit tests for approve→ledger→log, posting failure, and reconciliation.
- ledger/signals.py: extended `auto_post_payment` to include `transaction_type` routing, conversion metadata, idempotency, robust logging, and atomic posting.
- ledger/currency_utils.py: conversion functions rewritten to use `Decimal` with proper quantize for currency precision.

## How the client requirements map to the code

- Client asked: transaction types and routing → Implemented `Payment.transaction_type` and routing logic inside `ledger.signals.auto_post_payment`.
- Client asked: approve/reject endpoints → Implemented `PaymentViewSet.approve` and `reject` in `booking/views.py`. Approve sets status to `Completed` and triggers signal; reject sets status to `Rejected` and logs action.
- Client asked: auto transaction numbers → Implemented in `Payment.save()`.
- Client asked: action logs → Implemented `PaymentActionLog` records on approval, rejection, ledger creation, and posting failures. Also appended fallback traces to `payment.remarks` when log creation fails inside a transaction to maintain an audit trail.
- Client asked: atomic, idempotent ledger posting → Implemented `transaction.atomic()` and `Account.objects.select_for_update()`; lookup of `LedgerEntry.metadata.payment_id` provides idempotency.
- Client asked: reconciliation for payments created via bulk operations → Implemented `reconcile_payments` management command that uses the same posting handler.

## How to verify and operate

1) Quick manual verification (already used during development):

```powershell
& ".\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1"
python -u -c "import runpy; runpy.run_path('scripts/verify_payment_approve_and_ledger.py')"
```

2) Run reconciliation dry-run and apply if results are as expected:

```powershell
python manage.py reconcile_payments
python manage.py reconcile_payments --apply --limit 50
```

3) Run the booking tests we added:

```powershell
python manage.py test booking
```

## Notes, caveats and next steps

- Booking serializer still uses `bulk_create` for nested `Payment` objects. This is intentionally left unchanged to avoid larger breaking changes. The reconciliation command is provided to find and post any payments missed by signals.
- The tests include lightweight mocking to avoid heavy dependencies. A follow-up improvement is to add full end-to-end tests using production-like data.
- We faked a migration earlier in one environment because the database already contained the schema; ensure migrations are applied normally in other environments.

## Quick changelog (for reviewers)

- Added `transaction_type`, auto `transaction_number`, and `PaymentActionLog`.
- Extended ledger posting logic for routing and conversion and improved robustness.
- Added reconciliation command and unit tests.

## Contact / verification

If anything in this document is unclear or you want the remaining items automated (CI integration, replace `bulk_create` to ensure signals run in-line), say which item to prioritize and it will be scheduled next.
