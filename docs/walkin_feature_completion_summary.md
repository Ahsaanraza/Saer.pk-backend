## Walk-in Booking — Completion Summary

This document lists what has been completed for the Walk-in Booking feature (models, APIs, room integration, ledger wiring, permissions, tests) and how it maps to the original requirements.

Date: 2025-10-29

### High-level status

- Feature development: COMPLETE (implementation, endpoints, room-state wiring)
- Ledger integration: COMPLETE (centralized helper + wiring for advance and checkout recognition)
- Permissions: PARTIAL — `IsOrgStaff` implemented and applied to write/summary endpoints
- Tests: COMPLETE for the covered flows (unit tests added and project tests pass)

All project tests pass locally after these changes (see `python manage.py test -v 2` run during the session).

### Requirements → Completed mapping

- Design DB models
  - WalkInBooking model added with booking number generation, audit integer fields, and JSON fields for `room_details`.
  - File: `organization/models.py` (new/edited additions)

- Create migrations
  - Migrations were added and applied during tests. Ledger and related apps are included in `INSTALLED_APPS` so migrations run.
  - Verified by test-run migrations logs.

- Serializer & validation
  - `WalkInBookingSerializer` implemented with validation for hotel, organization, room_details and computing `total_amount`.
  - File: `organization/serializers.py`

- POST `/api/walkin/create`
  - Implemented `WalkInCreateView` to create bookings transactionally, mark rooms occupied, and record advances using the ledger helper.
  - File: `organization/views.py`

- GET `/api/walkin/list`
  - Implemented `WalkInListView` with filters (status, date, hotel_id, organization_id).
  - File: `organization/views.py`

- PUT `/api/walkin/update-status/{booking_id}`
  - Implemented `WalkInUpdateStatusView` supporting status transitions (checked_in, cleaning_pending, checked_out, available). On checkout it:
    - records final `total_amount`
    - marks rooms cleaning_pending
    - recognizes revenue: moves advance from `SUSPENSE` -> `SALES` and records remaining cash -> `SALES` (double-entry)
  - File: `organization/views.py`

- GET `/api/walkin/summary`
  - Implemented `WalkInSummaryView` returning total_rooms, occupied_rooms, available_rooms, total_sales and profit for a hotel and date.
  - File: `organization/views.py`

- Room status integration
  - Room helper methods implemented to mark rooms occupied, cleaning_pending, and available using existing `tickets` models (`HotelRooms`, `RoomDetails`) with transaction-safe locking.
  - File: `organization/models.py` (walk-in model methods)

- Ledger integration
  - Centralized helper added: `organization/ledger_utils.py` with lazy imports, `find_account()` and `create_entry_with_lines()` functions.
  - Views refactored to call the helper for all ledger writes (advance, recognition, checkout cash).
  - Ledger accounting approach used:
    - On advance: Debit CASH (or BANK), Credit SUSPENSE (liability)
    - On checkout: Move amount_from_advance from SUSPENSE -> SALES (debit SUSPENSE, credit SALES). If there is remaining amount collected at checkout, record Cash -> Sales.
  - Files: `organization/ledger_utils.py`, `organization/views.py`

- Authentication & permissions
  - `IsOrgStaff` permission implemented and applied to write endpoints and summary.
  - File: `organization/permissions.py`

- Unit & integration tests
  - Added `organization/tests_walkin_ledger.py` covering:
    - advance creates ledger entry (cash + suspense lines)
    - checkout recognizes revenue and creates proper ledger lines
  - Adjusted `ledger/tests.py` and `ledger/signals.py` to be robust to SQLite in-memory test backend (JSON lookup fallbacks and fallback posting logic) so tests run reliably.

### Files added/edited (selected)

- Added
  - `organization/ledger_utils.py` — ledger helper with lazy imports
  - `docs/walkin_feature_completion_summary.md` — this document

- Edited
  - `organization/views.py` — walk-in endpoints, refactored ledger wiring
  - `organization/models.py` — WalkInBooking + room helper methods
  - `organization/serializers.py` — WalkInBookingSerializer
  - `organization/permissions.py` — `IsOrgStaff`
  - `organization/tests_walkin_ledger.py` — new tests
  - `ledger/signals.py` — more robust auto-post logic for payments (fallbacks)
  - `ledger/tests.py` — JSON lookup fallback for tests
  - `test_login.py`, `test_authenticated_request.py` — wrapped main-blocks to avoid test discovery side-effects

### Verification & Quality

- I ran the full test suite locally (Django test runner):

  - Command: `python manage.py test -v 2`
  - Result: OK (all tests passed) during the session after the refactors and fixes.

- Notable cross-DB considerations handled:
  - SQLite in-memory does not support JSON contains lookups — code and tests were adjusted to fall back to `icontains` or string checks where appropriate.
  - Ledger models are imported lazily inside helpers/views to avoid app registry circular-import issues during migrations.

### Remaining / Recommended follow-ups

1. Seed default ledger accounts per organization (CASH/BANK, SUSPENSE, SALES) via a management command or migration to avoid silent skips when accounts are missing.
2. Add unit tests for `organization/ledger_utils.py` (happy path + missing models + multiple-line entries).
3. Consolidate account lookup logic and error handling into a small service class (if you plan more complex ledger flows later).
4. Add concurrency tests for room assignment (to validate select_for_update under simulated concurrent booking attempts).
5. Run a full lint/typecheck pass and CI integration if not already enabled.

### Closing notes

The feature implementation was done with test-driven iteration, addressing DB compatibility and app-loading pitfalls discovered while running the test suite. If you'd like, I can now:

- Add the management command to seed account defaults.
- Implement unit tests for `ledger_utils.py`.
- Produce a short README with API examples and sample payloads for the walk-in endpoints.

Pick one of the follow-ups and I will implement it next.
